; Set the game timings here.
; The key name is the level at which it is applied.
; The values are a space separated list of the following numbers:
;   - Gravity in 1/256th of 1G, so 5120 = 20G.
;   - ARE in frames, on a normal block placement. Note that lockflash lasts 3 frames and is included in this count.
;   - ARE in frames, after a line clear. Note that lockflash lasts 3 frames and is included in this count.
;   - Frames until DAS kicks in.
;   - Lock delay after the piece touches the stack in frames.
;   - Length of the line clear animation in frames.
;   - A fade parameter. If it is 0, no fade happens. If it is 1, the piece will disappear upon locking. If it is greater
;     than 1, the piece will fade out that many frames after locking.
;   - A garbage parameter. If it is greater than 0, the bottom line of the field will be copied once that many pieces
;     are locked without clearing lines. If it is negative, the bottom row gets copied, then inverted (empty becomes
;     filled and vice-versa) unless the bottom row only contains garbage blocks.
;   - An effect parameter. This is a 32-bit bitfield of flags. If a flag is set, this effect will be active until a
;     future section turns it off. If the effect is a one-off, it takes effect whenever the bit is set. There are
;     no effects defined yet.
; The game has room for 1023 entries.

; Credits is the timing data for the credits roll. Is has the same format as the other timing data, except two fields
; are added to the end: endlevel and duration.
;   - endlevel is the level at which the game ends, the field is cleared, and a 5 second countdown begins for the roll.
;   - duration is the length of the roll in frames.
