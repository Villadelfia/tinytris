# Tinytris

A minimal implementation of a TGM2-like tetris game. Intended to be played while doing other things.

## Controls

Controls are hardcoded, but easy enough to adjust in the source file.

- A/D: Left/right
- W: Sonic drop
- S: Soft drop
- J/L: Rotate CCW
- K: Rotate CW
- R: Restart game
- ESC: Quit game

## Features

You just play. If you need to pause, just click away and the game will pause. There are intentionally basically no features.
