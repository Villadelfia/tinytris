# Tinytris

A minimal implementation of a TGM2-like tetris game, with some modern amenities. Intended to be played while doing other things.

## Controls

Controls are hardcoded, but easy enough to adjust in the source file.

- `A/D`: Left/right
- `W`: Sonic drop
- `S`: Soft drop
- `N`: Hard drop
- `J/L`: Rotate CCW
- `K`: Rotate CW
- `R`: Restart game
- `ESC`: Quit game
- `-`: Scale down
- `=`: Scale up
- `P`: Mute/unmute.

## Features

You just play. If you need to pause, just click away and the game will pause. There are intentionally basically no features.
