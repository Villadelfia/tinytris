- A hard drop button as well as a sonic drop button are provided.
- Infinite speed curve, with the first 999 levels matching TAP Master mode.

## Replacing graphics
The main skin for the blocks can be replaced by providing a file named `block.png` in a `data` directory alongside the game exe.

This image should contain a 4 wide by 2 high grid of square images. These images represent the shapes:

```text
XILO
ZTJS
```

X here being the skin used when you top out.
