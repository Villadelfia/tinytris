# Tinytris

A minimal implementation of a TGM2-like tetris game, with some modern amenities.

- 180Â° IRS is possible by holding A and C during ARE.
- The rotation system can be switched between TGM2 and TGM3 mode.
- A hard drop button as well as a sonic drop button are provided.
- Infinite speed curve, with the first 999 levels matching TAP Master mode.
- Automatic pause on focus loss and short delay before restarting.

Intended to be played while doing other things.
